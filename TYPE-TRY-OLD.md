## Desirable products

Where do clothing and fabrics come from? Who made them and under what circumstances? Often there is no answer to these questions, even when asking them in expensive stores.

Wouldn’t it be nice to wear clothes where it is clear who made them? Where the conditions of fabrication are good and the trade is fair?  

TYPE-TRY wants that, sharing experience, collaborating with partners in the clothing chain, who think and act the same way. To make the production, resources and materials traceable for every garment. TYPE-TRY supports the idea of ‘true cost’ and ‘slow fashion’, adding to the pleasure of wearing the clothes.

The scarves are the result of many peoples’ work and creativity from rural Bangladesh to the cities of the Netherlands and the shores of the United States.

Beautiful women of Bangladesh embroider the scarves by using the traditional Nakshi Kantha technique. The silk of the scarves is made of the best quality, Rajshahi Silk. The fabric is embossed in a workplace in Dhaka and embroidered in Dinajpur, a poor region in the northwest of Bangladesh.

All under supervision of Kumudini Welfare Trust of Bengal. This NGO is part of the World Fair Trade Forum and Ecota Fair Trade Forum. In 2008 they received the Award of Excellence for Handicrafts South Asia from Unesco.

Under the name of Generous Gesture, the scarves have won a Bronze Award for the European Design Award 2010 in the category ‘Self Initiated Projects’

Generous Gesture has been nominated for the German Design Award 2012.

Claudia Mens

I am the child of the woods.
We lived in a wooden house. At a dirt road.
Endlessly tinker with acorns.
Myself hiding under the ferns.
Preferably in a sweater and pants.
Wow, what a freedom, what a space.
Always together with other kids.

“Watching is a verb,” my mother would say “look at the world. Look how beautiful that portrait has been painted.”
I drew notebooks. Making atmospheres and environments, little peepshows. Then crept behind my mom’s Husqvarna sewing machine and sewed a wide comfy skirt. To climb into trees.

After three decades, running a studio from 1980 till 2010, it was time for something else. Claudia went looking and longing for the woods of her childhood. She found that feeling back on Martha's Vineyard in the USA, where she began drawing with childlike pleasure and painting. Arose leafs and fern motifs, inspired by her travels in Africa, South America and Asia.

She designed a series of scarves with type and motifs of leafs, produced by NGO Kumudini Welfare Trust in Bangladesh. In 2016, she started with a lot of spirit and fun TYPE-TRY.

Besides the products of TYPE-TRY, similar to work in all of the photo's on this website, design can be made by Claudia as a special custom assignment. Ask her: claudia@petr.com

Working together

Working together
November 11, 2016
Beautiful Women of Bangladesh embroider the scarves by using the traditional Nakshi Kantha technique. All under supervision of Kumudini Welfare Trust of Bengal. Sharing ideas and learning from each others profession, the result is always better than doing entirely on your own.

Selina Biswas and many other women have mastered the Nakshi Kantha embroidering technique. | watch the video |

### TYPE-TRY design process

October 06, 2016 in design process
Good design is like a good marriage, always balancing between desired similarities and necessary differences. If it looks simple and easy, it probably did cost a lot of hours fighting. The achievement is great. The dissonant is interesting!

### “The complexity of simplicity”

If you don't notice, it must be good designed. How to draw expressive lines.

By sketching the designer is organizing thoughts, talking to self. Testing ideas against the real world. Examining options without the need to produce all of them for real.

Claudia Mens

I am the child of the woods.
We lived in a wooden house. At a dirt road.
Endlessly tinker with acorns.
Myself hiding under the ferns.
Preferably in a sweater and pants.
Wow, what a freedom, what a space.
Always together with other kids.

“Watching is a verb,” my mother would say “look at the world. Look how beautiful that portrait has been painted.”
I drew notebooks. Making atmospheres and environments, little peepshows. Then crept behind my mom’s Husqvarna sewing machine and sewed a wide comfy skirt. To climb into trees.

After three decades, running a studio from 1980 till 2010, it was time for something else. Claudia went looking and longing for the woods of her childhood. She found that feeling back on Martha's Vineyard in the USA, where she began drawing with childlike pleasure and painting. Arose leafs and fern motifs, inspired by her travels in Africa, South America and Asia.

She designed a series of scarves with type and motifs of leafs, produced by NGO Kumudini Welfare Trust in Bangladesh. In 2016, she started with a lot of spirit and fun TYPE-TRY.

Besides the products of TYPE-TRY, similar to work in all of the photo's on this website, design can be made by Claudia as a special custom assignment. Ask her: claudia@petr.com

TYPE-TRY is initiated by Claudia Mens, located at Rietveld 56, 2611 LM in Delft, The Netherlands.
